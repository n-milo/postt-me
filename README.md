postt.me is my IES project, by Nikola Milosevic. You can visit the site at http://postt.me

# Libraries Used

I used [Parsedown](http://parsedown.org/) for parsing Markdown style in posts.

I used [video.js](https://videojs.com/) to play videos in the browser.

I used [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) (not really a library, but whatever) to extract thumbnails, video length, and other data from videos.
